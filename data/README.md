# Data
Here's is where we would put that, except we can't.
## Problem
Unfortunately our data is too large to contained in Git, and we are not allowed to use Git LFS. So we cam up with a solution.

## Solution
During our data processing and final project we will use the `vroom` library to import the CSV file live from the internet so that we don't have to download and store the file locally.

However, we must still have a data folder for our grading. So we will put smaller files in this folder instead. But will still use the Internet CSV files instead.
